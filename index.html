        <![endif]--><div id=wrapper><div class=snappish-main><div class=container><h2>Baby ...</h2></div><div class=container><h2>Job hunting <strong>sucks</strong></h2></div><div class=container><h2>ALOT</h2></div><div class=container><h2>Just to put it into perspective</h2></div><div class=container><h2>I started looking for a job in Los Angeles on Sept. 4, 2012 &mdash; or just <i>3 months</i> after I started at the Times.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>For the next <strong>9 months</strong> I ended up applying to over <strong><i>47</i></strong> different jobs, <strong>3 apprenticeships</strong>, and <strong>5 recruiting sites</strong> targeting Los Angeles, the Bay Area, New York City and even Colorado.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>And guess what? <strong>Most of them said no.</strong></h2></div><div class=container><h2>One job even asked my why'd I'd even apply for an engineering job given my journalism background.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>Another called me "promising" but ended up recanting that once I tried to solve a programming puzzle.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>And don't even get me started on the Disney interview!</h2><h5>They did end up offering me an internship though. <strong>I said no.</strong></h5></div><div class=container><h2>I even reached out to <strong>2</strong> former employers asking for my old jobs back. One said sure, while the other had folded.</h2><h5>That barista life.</h5></div><div class=container><h2>The apprenticeships seemed promising, but most of them wanted <strong>$5000</strong> or more just to attend!</h2><h5>The promise was that you'd land a job making $75K+, but not after paying back those loans you took out just to attend.</h5></div><div class=container><h2>Job application No. 36 ended up being the one that worked. That was the first time I reached out to <strong>CIR</strong>. I would end up hearing back, but that wasn't before I quit the Times, packed up all my shit and drove home with no job at all.</h2><br><h5>I also did <strong>1 side project</strong> and had coffee with a journo-turned-software developer who told me to join his company! (He ended up getting fired about 3 months later. The company downscaled).</h5></div><div class=container><h2>Two jobs in LA even called me back! But I had already moved all my shit to the Bay. Talk about timing.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>I briefly took a remote position as a junior engineer for a small startup in Palo Alto. FInally a software job! ... except the job ended up 1. not working with my schedule (it was remote and the boss had odd hours when he was available) and 2. it wasn't really journalism based. Sure I was making money but I was stressing out about working remotely and not having a conventional work environment. So, I ended up leaving.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>For a second, I thought I'd never find a job. I started asking myself if I was even capable of doing the work I'd been applying for. My self-esteem as at an all-time low.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>I finally ended up with a job offer from a startup in the city. Finally! &mdash; I thought &mdash; I'll have a job, doing something I love, making decent money. I said yes and was super excited.</h2><h5>They were offering me around $60k which was the most money I'd ever seen. Also, I wouldn't say I loved the product itself, but the programming would've been great. I was juiced!</h5></div><div class=container><h2>Until literally 48 hours before my start date I got an email:</h2><br><blockquote class=blockquote><p>"Apologize in advance for this, but I think after some group introspection of our needs, I think we're going to try to find someone senior ..."</p></blockquote></div><div class=container><h2>A ton of bricks hit my chest. It was like the universe was playing some kind of joke on me and I wasn't laughing. I burst into tears. It really felt like I lost. All these people my age (or younger) were succeeding and I was sitting in my old room at my parents' house feeling like I couldn't accomplish shit.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>Luckily, one application ended up coming through. <strong>CIR</strong> said they were still interested. I went and interviewed with folks and got an offer &mdash; as a contractor (I didn't leave LA just to contract AGAIN). There was no guarantee I'd have a job in two months. But, I liked the work so I said yes.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>My first day was June 4, 2013. I barely had enough money to buy the Clipper card to take me to Berkeley BART. On Aug. 11, 2013, I was offered a fulltime position. Nearly a year since I decided I wanted to leave the Times.</h2><br><h5>And the irony? A HUGE reason CIR considered me was because of a recommendation from someone at the Times.</h5></div><div class=container><h2>It took around 3 years to finally obtain the job I've been looking for. I didn't write my first program until the summer of 2011.</h2><br><h5>I bought a lot of programming books that year. Thanks student loans!</h5></div><div class=container><h2>Now, I'm not saying I didn't work hard. Or that I was lucky. But, that year put me through hell. It was one of the toughest things I've had to deal with. I say all this to say that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. It won't come quickly or without pain, but it will come.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>We all have hopes and dreams, but they don't ever come easy. We have to fight and sweat to achieve 'em. And job hunting is the first part of that.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>This whole job shit is hard, but I believe in manifesting your own destiny (as long as it doesn't involve stealing land from native populations).</h2></div><div class=container><h2>Even more so, I believe that <strong>YOU</strong> capacity to achieve the things you want to achieve.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>So don't psyche yourself out of being amazing before you even get a shot to cut your teeth. Things will come with time.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>But, they won't come without hard, monotonous work. Keep grinding, keep searching and keep learning. I have the upmost faith that you'll find the right job when it's time.</h2></div><div class=container><h2>Sorry if this was preachy. Just wanted to keep you motived. And I love you :)</h2></div><div class=container><h2>Aaron.</h2></div></div></div><script src=scripts/ad139b1b.vendor.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
